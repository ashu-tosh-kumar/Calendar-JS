# Calendar

This project aims to use JavaScript as a back-end to build a sample Calendar application. We aim not to use any external library for any purpose except very native standard libraries

The application accepts a date string in `YYYY-MM-DD` format and returns a calendar for that month filled with previous and/or next month dates to fulfill a `7x6` matrix.

For example, for the input `2022-01-31` , the calendar representation is below:

```
    S       M       T       W       T       F       S
    26     27      28       29      30      31      1
    2       3       4       5       6       7       8
    9       10      11      12      13      14      15
    16      17      18      19      20      21      22
    23      24      25      26      27      28      29
    30      31      1       2       3       4        5
```
